# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Project Description
This was an early HW assignment requiring me to develop a personal web page for employers to utilize. This was the second version produced, and far superior to the first. This one utilized Bootstrap, which made creating a grid much easier. Still, the ultimate result is not ideal. More time will likely be devoted to this assignment at a later date.

# Notes
<br>

# Remaining Work
More CSS editing and general playing around wtih the design are needed;<br>
further study of bootstrap pre-built features should improve many of the troublesome elements.<br>
