# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Project Description
This project is my ongoing work on a personal portfolio, which I will host and hopefully use to attain employment.<br>
This was the second version produced, and far superior to the first.<br>
This one utilizes Bootstrap and Materialize, which made creating a grid easier and allowed the carousel feature, respectively.<br>

# How to Use
Access the hosted version here: https://daniibooii.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/<br>
Or, just open up index.html with your preferred browser!<br>

# Notes
Still a bit to go!<br>

# Remaining Work
I hope to personalize the look and feel of my portfolio further.<br>
Soon, I intend to make it a one-page app, using React.js.<br>
