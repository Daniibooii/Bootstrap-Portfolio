# Project Description
This project is my personal portfolio, which I update each time I learn a new skill.<br>
It is one its third version and still going strong.<br>

# How to Use
Access the hosted version here: https://daniibooii.github.io/Portfolio/<br>
Or, just open up index.html with your preferred browser!<br>

# Notes
The next step: converting to React.js!<br>
That may become its own project, with a separate repo.<br>
